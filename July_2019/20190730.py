# Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point,
# find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

# For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.


# Solution

    if not head:
        return 0
    return 1 + length(head.next)


def intersection(a, b):
    m, n = length(a), length(b)

    if m > n:

            cur_a = cur_a.next
    else:
