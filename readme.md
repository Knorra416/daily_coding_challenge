## Daily Coding Challenge

I am using daily problems from this site: https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/. 
The goal is to increase my Python skills outside of my day-to-day workflows. 
The repo is split by month_year directories.

Each file is split as follows: 
1) The problem statement commented out at the top of the script.
2) My best solution attempt follows this problem. 
3) The solution (provided 24 hours after the problem email) is presented at the
end of each file.
